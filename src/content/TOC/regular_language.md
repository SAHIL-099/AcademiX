## Regular Languages

### Introduction

A **regular language** is a formal language that can be defined by a regular expression and recognized by a finite automaton. Regular languages are the simplest class in the Chomsky hierarchy.

### Properties

1. **Closure Properties**:
   - Regular languages are closed under:
     - Union
     - Intersection
     - Complement
     - Concatenation
     - Kleene Star

2. **Finite Automata**:
   - **Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)**: Recognizes regular languages with exactly one transition for each input.
   - **Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)**: Allows multiple transitions for the same input.

3. **Regular Expressions**:
   - Provide a concise way to represent regular languages.

### Examples of Regular Languages

- The set of strings over `{0, 1}` with an even number of `0`s.
- The set of strings that do not contain the substring `101`.

### Limitations

- Regular languages cannot handle nested structures or patterns requiring memory, such as balanced parentheses.

### Conclusion

Regular languages and regular expressions are foundational concepts in the Theory of Computation, providing the basis for understanding more complex languages and computational processes.
