# Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Grammars (CFG)

## Introduction

The Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Grammars helps us show that some languages are not context-free. It states that if a language is context-free, certain strings in that language can be "pumped" (repeated) in a specific way.

## Statement of the Pumping Lemma

If \( L \) is a context-free language, then there exists a number \( p \) (pumping length) such that any string \( s \) in \( L \) with length at least \( p \) can be split into five parts:

\[ s = uvxyz \]

where:
1. \( |vxy| <= p \) (the combined length of \( v \), \( x \), and \( y \) is at most \( p \))
2. \( |vy| >= 1 \) (the parts \( v \) and \( y \) together must contain at least one symbol)
3. For all \( i >= 0 \), the string \( uv^ixy^iz \) is still in \( L \).

## How to Use the Pumping Lemma

1. **Assume** that the language \( L \) is context-free.
2. **Pick** a string \( s \in L \) with \( |s| >= p \).
3. **Split** \( s \) into \( uvxyz \) according to the lemma's rules.
4. **Show** that for some \( i \), the string \( uv^ixy^iz \) is not in \( L \).
5. **Conclude** that \( L \) is not context-free.

## Example

### Language: \( L = \{ a^n b^n c^n \mid n >= 0 \} \)

To prove \( L \) is not context-free:

1. Assume \( L \) is context-free.
2. Let \( p \) be the pumping length.
3. Take the string \( s = a^p b^p c^p \).
4. Split \( s = uvxyz \).

### Cases

- **If \( v \) and \( y \) are both from \( a \)s, \( b \)s, or \( c \)s**: Pumping them will create an imbalance (e.g., more \( a \)s than \( b \)s or \( c \)s).
  
- **If \( v \) contains \( a \)s and \( y \) contains \( b \)s**: Pumping will again break the balance.

In every case, \( uv^ixy^iz \) does not belong to \( L \), proving that \( L \) is not context-free.

## Conclusion

The Pumping Lemma is a useful tool for identifying languages that cannot be generated by context-free grammars, helping us understand the limitations of context-free languages.
